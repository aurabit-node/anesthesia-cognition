<section id="introduction">
<h1>Anesthesia and Cognitive Function</h1>

<p>
Anesthesia is fundamental to modern surgical practice, allowing complex procedures to be
performed safely and humanely. With increasing life expectancy and surgical volumes,
attention has shifted toward long-term outcomes, particularly perioperative cognitive
health.
</p>

<p>
Cognitive changes after surgery range from transient delirium to persistent neurocognitive
disorders. These outcomes are especially relevant in elderly patients and those with
pre-existing neurological vulnerability.
</p>

<p>
Authoritative overviews are available from the
<a href="https://www.asahq.org" target="_blank">American Society of Anesthesiologists</a>,
<a href="https://www.who.int" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a>, and
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" target="_blank">PubMed</a>.

<section id="pocd">
<h2>Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction (POCD)</h2>

<p>
POCD describes a measurable decline in memory, attention, executive function, or processing
speed following anesthesia and surgery. Unlike delirium, POCD may persist for weeks or
months.
</p>

<p>
Large studies such as the International Study of Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction
(ISPOCD) identified age, duration of anesthesia, and surgical stress as major contributors.
</p>
</section>

<hr>

<section id="definitions">
<h2>Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorders</h2>

<p>
To harmonize terminology, expert consensus groups introduced the term
<strong>Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorders (PNDs)</strong>, encompassing pre-existing
impairment, delirium, delayed recovery, and postoperative neurocognitive disorder.
</p>

<p>
This classification aligns perioperative cognitive decline with DSM-5 diagnostic
frameworks and is endorsed by journals such as
<a href="https://jamanetwork.com" target="_blank">JAMA</a>.
</p>
</section>

<hr>

<section id="mechanisms">
<h2>Pathophysiological Mechanisms</h2>

<p>
Neuroinflammation plays a central role in postoperative cognitive impairment. Surgical trauma
induces systemic cytokine release, microglial activation, and blood–brain barrier disruption.
</p>

<p>
Additional contributors include cerebral microembolization, altered perfusion, oxidative
stress, and neurotransmitter imbalance.
</p>
</section>

<hr>

<section id="anesthetic-agents">
<h2>Effects of Anesthetic Agents</h2>

<p>
Volatile anesthetics (sevoflurane, isoflurane) and intravenous agents (propofol) have been
extensively studied for their cognitive effects. Evidence suggests agent-specific and
dose-dependent influences.
</p>

<p>
Pharmacological reviews are available via
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books" target="_blank">NCBI Bookshelf</a> and
<a href="https://www.uptodate.com" target="_blank">UpToDate</a>.
</p>
</section>

<hr>

<section id="regional-anesthesia">
<h2>Regional Anesthesia and Cognitive Outcomes</h2>

<p>
Regional techniques such as spinal, epidural, and paravertebral blocks may reduce cognitive
risk by limiting systemic anesthetic exposure and opioid consumption.
</p>

<p>
However, randomized trials show heterogeneous results, underscoring the need for patient-
specific anesthetic planning.
</p>
</section>

<hr>

<section id="risk-factors">
<h2>Risk Factors</h2>

<p>
Risk factors include advanced age, frailty, baseline cognitive impairment, prolonged surgery,
and perioperative complications.
</p>
</section>

<hr>

<section id="assessment">
<h2>Cognitive Assessment</h2>

<p>
Common tools include the MMSE, MoCA, and neuropsychological batteries. Baseline assessment
is critical for accurate postoperative interpretation.
</p>
</section>

<hr>

<section id="prevention">
<h2>Prevention and Mitigation</h2>

<p>
Strategies include multimodal analgesia, avoidance of deliriogenic drugs, early mobilization,
and adherence to ERAS protocols
(<a href="https://erassociety.org" target="_blank">ERAS Society</a>).
</p>
</section>

<hr>

<section id="future">
<h2>Future Directions</h2>

<p>
Future research focuses on biomarkers, neuroprotective strategies, and precision anesthesia
to preserve cognitive health across the perioperative continuum.
